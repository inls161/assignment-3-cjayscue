<p>I would like you to answer the following questions in a short answer format using Markdown.</p>
<h1 id="turn-all-of-the-questions-below-into-headers.">Turn all of the questions below into headers.</h1>
<h2 id="if-the-questions-are-related-make-the-headers-reflect-this-by-subordinating-them.">If the questions are related, make the headers reflect this by subordinating them.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For questions that ask for a list, use the appropriate Markdown syntax to create either ordered or unordered lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text for emphasis in your responses.</p></li>

<h1 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h1>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Cloud9</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
<li>Pandoc</li>
<li>Unix</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="which-have-you-found-most-potentially-useful">Which have you found most potentially useful?</h1>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong></p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>It is immensely helpful to have commits and changes simply and easily displayed in GitHub.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-have-been-the-most-difficult-to-learn">What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</h1>
<p>Unix, <strong>definately</strong> Unix.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-they-been-particularly-difficult-to-learn-and-use">Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use?</h2>
<p>Because the only programming I had ever done had been in PHP so none of the terms we used or tasks we were performing initially made any sense to me.</p>
<h1 id="what-tools-would-you-like-to-learn-more-about">What tools would you like to learn more about?</h1>
<p>I would like to learn more of the capabilities of GitHub primarily because I love the <em>collaborative purpose</em> of the application.</p>

<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
